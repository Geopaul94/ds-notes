    -   _Q: How does Bubble sort work?_
    -   _A: The algorithm works by comparing each pair of adjacent elements in the list and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated from the beginning until the entire list is sorted. The largest element "bubbles up" to its correct position in each pass._
    -   _Q: What is the time complexity of Bubble Sort?_

    _A: Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort._
    _Q: How does Insertion Sort work?_
    _A: The algorithm iterates through the list, considering one element at a time and inserting it into its correct position among the already sorted elements. It repeats this process until the entire list is sorted._
    _Q: What is the time complexity of Insertion Sort?_
    _A: The time complexity of Insertion Sort is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, where "n" is the number of elements in the list. It performs well for small datasets or partially sorted datasets._

13. **Selection Sort:**

    -   _Q: What is Selection Sort?_
    -   _A: Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sorted and the unsorted. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the ordering) element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part._
    -   _Q: How does Selection Sort work?_
    -   _A: The algorithm divides the list into two parts: the sorted part, initially empty, and the unsorted part, which contains all the elements. In each iteration, it finds the smallest element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part. This process continues until the entire list is sorted._
    -   _Q: What is the time complexity of Selection Sort?_
    -   _A: The time complexity of Selection Sort is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, where "n" is the number of elements in the list. Similar to other quadratic sorting algorithms, it is less efficient for large datasets._
    -   _Q: When is Selection Sort a suitable choice?_
    -   _A: Selection Sort is suitable for small datasets or when the auxiliary memory is limited because it performs a minimal number of swaps. However, for larger datasets, more efficient algorithms like quicksort or mergesort are preferred._
    -   _Q: What is the space complexity of Selection Sort?_

    -   _A: Selection Sort has a space complexity of O(1) because it only requires a constant amount of additional memory space for temporary variables._

14. **Quick Sort:**

    -   _Q: What is Quick Sort?_
    -   _A: Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array or list. It selects a "pivot" element and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively._
    -   _Q: How does Quick Sort work?_
    -   _A: The algorithm selects a pivot element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot. The process is repeated on the sub-arrays until the entire array is sorted._
    -   _Q: What is the time complexity of Quick Sort?_
    -   _A: The average and best-case time complexity of Quick Sort is O(n log n), making it one of the fastest sorting algorithms. However, in the worst case, when the pivot is consistently the smallest or largest element, it degrades to O(n^2)._
    -   _Q: When is Quick Sort a suitable choice?_
    -   _A: Quick Sort is suitable for large datasets due to its efficient average and best-case performance. It is often preferred over other sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, or insertion sort for its speed._
    -   _Q: What is the space complexity of Quick Sort?_
    -   _A: Quick Sort has a space complexity of O(log n) due to its recursive nature. The space is required for the call stack during the recursive calls. The partitioning is done in-place, making it efficient in terms of memory usage._

15. **Merge Sort:**

    -   _Q: What is Merge Sort?_
    -   _A: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that divides an input array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce a fully sorted array._
    -   _Q: How does Merge Sort work?_
    -   _A: The algorithm divides the unsorted array into two halves until each sub-array contains only one element. It then repeatedly merges adjacent sub-arrays to produce new sorted sub-arrays until the entire array is sorted._
    -   _Q: What is the time complexity of Merge Sort?_
    -   _A: The time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n) in all cases, making it a consistently efficient algorithm for large datasets. It divides the array into halves and merges them in a way that ensures logarithmic time complexity._
    -   _Q: When is Merge Sort a suitable choice?_
    -   _A: Merge Sort is suitable for scenarios where a stable, predictable, and consistent sorting algorithm is required. Its efficiency and stability make it a good choice for large datasets or linked lists._
    -   _Q: What is the space complexity of Merge Sort?_
    -   _A: Merge Sort has a space complexity of O(n) due to the need for additional space to store temporary arrays during the merging process. This makes it less memory-efficient than in-place algorithms like Quick Sort but more stable for large datasets._

16. **Stack**:

    -   _Q: What is a Stack?_
    -   _A: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of it as a stack of plates; you add a plate to the top and remove the topmost plate._
    -   _Q: How are operations performed on a Stack?_
    -   _A: There are two primary operations on a stack:_
        -   _Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack._
        -   _Pop: Removes the element from the top of the stack._
    -   _Q: What is the significance of the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle?_
    -   _A: The LIFO principle ensures that the most recently added element is the first one to be removed. This property is useful in various scenarios, such as managing function calls in recursion, tracking undo/redo operations, and parsing expressions._
    -   _Q: Can a stack be implemented using an array or a linked list?_
    -   _A: Yes, a stack can be implemented using either an array or a linked list. In an array implementation, a fixed-size array is used, and a pointer keeps track of the top element. In a linked list implementation, each element points to the one below it, and the head of the linked list represents the top of the stack._
    -   _Q: What is the time complexity of push and pop operations on a stack?_
    -   _A: The time complexity of both push and pop operations on a stack implemented using an array or linked list is O(1). These operations involve updating the top of the stack or the linked list head, making them constant time._
    -   _Q: What are some practical applications of a stack?_
    -   _A: Stacks are used in various applications, including expression evaluation, function call management in programming languages, undo mechanisms in software, backtracking algorithms, and parsing syntax in compilers._

17. **Queue:**

    -   _Q: What is a Queue?_
    -   _A: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. It means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Think of it as a line of people waiting; the person who arrives first is the first to leave._
    -   _Q: How are operations performed on a Queue?_
    -   _A: There are two primary operations on a queue:_
        -   _Enqueue: Adds an element to the back (end) of the queue._
        -   _Dequeue: Removes the element from the front (front) of the queue._
    -   _Q: What is the significance of the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle?_
    -   _A: The FIFO principle ensures that the order in which elements are added is the same order in which they are removed. This property is essential in scenarios such as process scheduling, printing tasks in a printer queue, and managing tasks in a breadth-first search algorithm._
    -   _Q: Can a queue be implemented using an array or a linked list?_
    -   _A: Yes, a queue can be implemented using either an array or a linked list. In an array implementation, two pointers, front and rear, are used to keep track of the elements. In a linked list implementation, the head and tail of the linked list represent the front and rear of the queue._
    -   _Q: What is the time complexity of enqueue and dequeue operations on a queue?_
    -   _A: The time complexity of both enqueue and dequeue operations on a queue implemented using an array or linked list is O(1). These operations involve updating the front or rear of the queue or linked list, making them constant time._
    -   _Q: What are some practical applications of a queue?_
    -   _A: Queues are used in various applications, including task scheduling in operating systems, managing print job queues, breadth-first search algorithms in graph traversal, handling requests in web servers, and simulating real-world scenarios in computer science._

18. **Hash Tables:**

    -   _Q: What is a Hash Table?_
    -   _A: A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, allowing for efficient retrieval and insertion operations. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, where the desired value can be found._
    -   _Q: How does a Hash Table work?_
    -   _A: The key is passed through a hash function, which converts it into an index in the array. The value associated with the key is then stored or retrieved from that index. Collisions, where multiple keys hash to the same index, are handled using techniques like chaining or open addressing._
    -   _Q: What is a Hash Function?_
    -   _A: A hash function is a mathematical function that takes an input (or "key") and produces a fixed-size string of characters, which typically represents an index in the array. A good hash function aims to distribute keys uniformly across the array to minimize collisions._
    -   _Q: What is Collision Resolution?_
    -   _A: Collision resolution is the process of handling situations where two or more keys hash to the same index. Common methods include:_
        -   _Chaining: Each bucket stores a linked list of key-value pairs._
        -   _Open Addressing: The system searches for the next available slot in the array._
    -   _Q: What is the time complexity of operations in a Hash Table?_
    -   _A: In the average case, with a well-designed hash function and minimal collisions, the time complexity of insertion, deletion, and retrieval is O(1). However, in the worst case (with many collisions), it could degrade to O(n), where n is the number of elements._
    -   _Q: When is a Hash Table a suitable choice?_
    -   _A: Hash tables are suitable for scenarios where quick insertion, deletion, and retrieval of key-value pairs are essential. They are widely used in databases, caches, language interpreters, and various applications where efficient data lookup is critical._
    -   _Q: What is the space complexity of a Hash Table?_
    -   _A: The space complexity depends on the number of key-value pairs and the underlying array size. In the average case, it is O(n), where n is the number of elements. However, this can vary depending on the implementation and the handling of collisions._
